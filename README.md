## 📂 Tasks Completed

✅ **Task 1: Student Performance Analysis**  
- Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on student performance dataset  
- Visualized score distributions and correlations  
- **Bonus:** Extra insights through additional visualizations  

✅ **Task 2: Customer Segmentation**  
- Applied KMeans clustering to identify customer groups  
- Reduced dimensions with PCA for visualization  
- **Bonus:** Used Elbow method & Silhouette Score for cluster validation  

✅ **Task 3: Forest Cover Type Prediction**  
- Built a classification model to predict forest cover types  
- Used XGBoost Classifier for better accuracy  
- **Bonus:** Feature importance visualization  

✅ **Task 4: Loan Approval Prediction**  
- Built ML models to predict loan approval based on applicant details  
- Preprocessed categorical & numerical features using pipelines  
- Compared **Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest**
